# MacroDaddy
>  A mobile-friendly Frontend application that utilizes an evidenced-based algorithm to calculate a person's Total Daily Expenditure (calories burned in a day) by user's biometric inputs and compares that to their caloric intake that is generated through The Nutrionix API, to calculate weight lose or gain in a given day.

## General Information
MacroDaddy was designed to have a centralized location for users to keep track of their macro-nutritional intake and compare them to their Total Daily Expenditure (TDEE), generated using the "Mifflin-St Jeor" formula. Their TDEE or BMR is calculated through the formula by calculating user's biometrics such as height, weight, age, and sex and compared using the Nutritionix API to search and output what the users ate that day and what nutritional content those dishes have. The user is able to record their calories, fats, proteins, and carbohydrates intake.



## Technologies Used
React, Sass, Redux

## Features
- Formula that translates user's biometric inputs to how many calories necessary in the day to lose/gain weight
- Nutritionix API that supports "natural language" to search robust database to for food items and their nutritional contents
- Selected foods will record and calculate user's macros consumption (Fats, Proteins, Carbohydrates, and Calories)
- Responsive design for mobile
